ai_pair_programming
The AI Pair Programming system leverages Artificial Intelligence to extend the traditional pair programming practice observed within Extreme Programming agile methodology to assist software developers in writing good quality code by suggesting lines of code, simplifying the existing code, improving code efficiency, and debugging the code, thereby increasing the developer’s productivity by reducing mistakes and cutting down on the time and quantum of work needed so that they can focus on more complicated tasks and solving problems.

System Framework:
Backend: The main engine behind the AI Pair Programming System will leverage a pre-trained Large Language Model, Google’s PaLM to realize the 4 use cases, as described later in the section.

Frontend: A frontend GUI will be designed to visualize and interact with the backend engine and perform the tasks captured in the following use-cases:

Code Completion: The AI Pair Programming System provides real-time, contextually relevant code suggestions to software developers through the GUI, enhancing their coding experience by offering intelligent recommendations for lines of code. This feature ensures that developers can quickly access potential solutions, speeding up the coding process.

Code Simplification: The system analyzes existing code after copying the code from the GUI and offers suggestions for simplifying complex code segments. By refactoring and optimizing code snippets, the AI Pair Programming System assists developers in creating cleaner, more maintainable code, aligning with best practices and coding standards.

Code Improvisation: In addition to aiding in code creation, the system simplifies existing code, reducing redundancy, and improving code efficiency. This simplification enhances maintainability and readability while ensuring code quality.

Code Debugging: The system incorporates intelligent debugging capabilities, identifying and highlighting potential bugs and errors in the code. By pinpointing issues and suggesting corrective actions, developers can troubleshoot more effectively, reducing the time spent on bug identification and resolution.
